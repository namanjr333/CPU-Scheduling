# CPU-Scheduling

1. Shortest Job First (SJF)
Purpose: SJF aims to minimize average waiting time by executing the shortest jobs first.

Implementation Details:

Comparator (cmp_SJF): Compares processes based on their burst time (BT). If burst times are equal, it uses arrival time (AT) to break ties.
Algorithm (SJF function):
Initialization: Initialize curr_time to track current time, total_BT for total burst time, and time_quantum for time slice.
Sorting: Sort processes by burst time.
Execution: Select the process that arrives before or at curr_time. Execute the process for its burst time or until completion if total_BT is less than burst time.
Gantt Chart: Print execution sequence ("P1 P2 ..."), update curr_time and total_BT.
Metrics Update: Update response time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Pros: Minimizes average waiting time for processes.

Cons: May cause starvation for longer processes.

2. Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF)
Purpose: SRJF is a preemptive version of SJF, where the scheduler can preempt the currently executing process if a shorter job arrives.

Implementation Details:

Comparator (cmp_SRJF): Similar to SJF, compares remaining burst time instead of total burst time.
Algorithm (SRJF function):
Initialization: Initialize curr_time to track current time, total_BT for total burst time, and time_quantum for time slice.
Sorting: Sort processes by remaining burst time.
Execution: Select the process that arrives before or at curr_time. Execute the process for a time quantum (here 1 unit).
Preemption: If another process with shorter remaining time arrives, preempt the current process.
Gantt Chart: Print execution sequence ("P1 P2 ..."), update curr_time and total_BT.
Metrics Update: Update response time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Pros: Reduces average response time and waiting time compared to SJF.

Cons: May lead to higher context switch overhead.

3. Longest Job First (LJF)
Purpose: LJF executes the longest jobs first, potentially leading to faster completion of larger tasks.

Implementation Details:

Comparator (cmp_LJF): Sorts processes in descending order of burst time.
Algorithm (LJF function):
Initialization: Initialize curr_time to track current time, total_BT for total burst time, and time_quantum for time slice.
Sorting: Sort processes by burst time in descending order.
Execution: Select the process that arrives before or at curr_time. Execute the process for its burst time.
Gantt Chart: Print execution sequence ("P1 P2 ..."), update curr_time and total_BT.
Metrics Update: Update response time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Pros: Can prioritize larger tasks and potentially reduce their waiting time.

Cons: Shorter jobs may starve if many long jobs arrive.

4. Longest Remaining Job First (LRJF)
Purpose: LRJF is a preemptive version of LJF, where the scheduler can preempt the currently executing process if a longer job arrives.

Implementation Details:

Comparator (cmp_LRJF): Sorts processes in descending order of remaining burst time.
Algorithm (LRJF function):
Initialization: Initialize curr_time to track current time, total_BT for total burst time, and time_quantum for time slice.
Sorting: Sort processes by remaining burst time in descending order.
Execution: Select the process that arrives before or at curr_time. Execute the process for a time quantum (here 1 unit).
Preemption: If another process with longer remaining time arrives, preempt the current process.
Gantt Chart: Print execution sequence ("P1 P2 ..."), update curr_time and total_BT.
Metrics Update: Update response time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Pros: Prioritizes execution of longer tasks while ensuring some progress on shorter tasks.

Cons: Increased complexity due to preemption.

5. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
Purpose: FCFS executes tasks in the order they arrive.

Implementation Details:

Comparator (cmp_FCFS): Sorts processes based on their arrival time.
Algorithm (FCFS function):
Initialization: Initialize curr_time to track current time and total_BT for total burst time.

Metrics Update: Update response time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Pros: Simple to implement and understand.

Cons: May lead to longer average waiting times, especially for shorter processes arriving later.

6. Round Robin (RR)
Purpose: RR executes tasks in a cyclic manner, allowing each task to run for a fixed time quantum.

Implementation Details:

Algorithm (RR function):
Initialization: Initialize curr_time to track current time, time_quantum for time slice (here 3 units), and total_BT for total burst time.
Round Robin Execution: Processes are executed in a round-robin manner using a queue.
Gantt Chart: Print execution sequence ("P1 P2 ..."), update curr_time and total_BT.
Metrics Update: Update response time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Pros: Ensures fair execution and prevents starvation.

Cons: May lead to higher context switch overhead.

7. Priority Scheduling (PS)
Purpose: PS executes tasks based on their priority.

Metrics Update: Update response time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Pros: Prioritizes important tasks based on their priority level.

Cons: May lead to starvation of lower priority tasks.

8. Multi Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)
Purpose: MLFQ uses multiple queues with different priorities to execute tasks, promoting shorter jobs to higher priority queues.

Implementation Details:

Comparator (cmp_MLFQ): Sorts processes based on their priority and burst time.
Algorithm (MLFQ function):
Initialization: Initialize curr_time to track current time, time_quantum for time slice (variable based on process priority), and total_BT for total burst time.
Multi-Level Queues: Processes are initially placed in a queue based on priority.
Execution: Execute processes from the highest priority queue, preempting lower priority tasks if necessary.
Promotion: After executing a task, its priority may be adjusted based on its behavior (e.g., penalizing long-running tasks).
Gantt Chart: Print execution sequence ("P1 P2 ..."), update curr_time and total_BT.
Metrics Update: Update response time, completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process.
Pros: Balances execution between short and long jobs, reducing response time for short jobs.

Cons: Complexity in managing multiple queues and priorities.

Summary:
Each scheduling algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different scenarios based on system requirements such as throughput, turnaround time, and fairness. The provided C++ code implements these algorithms with the goal of demonstrating their behavior and calculating performance metrics for comparison.
